**------------------------------------------------------IMPORTANT------------------------------------------------------**

We strongly suggest the Team to go through the DOCUMENTATION to understand the old and new application:

Documentation is common for PlanNXT, CastNXT and EventNXT:

Email the team if you have any questions:

**Install ruby and rails**

Please check whether you have the ruby and rails installed.

        ruby -v

Ruby version is 3.2.2 as mentioned in Gemfile

        rails -v

The rails version is 7.0.4

If you don't have the ruby or rails. Please follow the below processes.

- Install ruby-3.2.0 using Ruby version manager
   
        rvm get stable
        rvm install "ruby-3.2.0" or try rvm install "ruby-3.2.2"
        rvm use 3.2.0 or try rvm use 3.2.2

- Install PostgreSQL

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
        
        PostgreSQL may require to create a role to allow rails to connect to the Postgre database. In AWS cloud9 ubuntu system, we executed 
        sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive ubuntu

- Clone the latest git repo

        git clone https://github.com/CSCE-606-Event360/Spring2024EventNXT.git

- Change directory to the new app

        cd Spring2024EventNXT/EventNXT_new_app

- Bundle install

        bundle install

- Set ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        NXT_APP_URL -> events360 website link
        NXT_APP_ID -> client ID (registered with events360)
        NXT_APP_SECRET -> client secret (registered with events360)
        EVENT_NXT_APP_URL -> eventNXT WEBSITE LINK.
        ALLOWED_HOST -> eventnxt url in heroku or local url

- To set environment variables, please follow below procedure: command:

        export NXT_APP_URL="http://events360.herokuapp.com/"
        export NXT_APP_ID="aCgXCUDxHSvkp12ZaLweRSVq0pmznGpFasldrE3EZpQ"
        export NXT_APP_SECRET="iN9O2qGyA9n3nauMXOl6x5SDh08i27Nb1gs-fIjI6g0"
        export EVENT_NXT_APP_URL="https://eventnxtprodfall2023-a37dec4f8dd9.herokuapp.com/" #your eventnxt app url in development heroku
        export ALLOWED_HOST="your eventnxt app url in development heroku"

NOTE: NXT_APP_URL, NXT_APP_ID, NXT_APP_SECRET are env variables used for oauth client registration with CRM event360 server. http://events360.herokuapp.com/ is customer production CRM server. You should not use this for development. For development you need to clone Event360 repo and run the app. This admin login details are present in db/seeds.rb file of Event360 repo. Then you can go to application management and create a new test client. once the new client is registered you can get NXT_APP_ID and NXT_APP_SECRET from the UI and set it in your development env as shown above. you need to save client callback in this new test client in event360 app. To get an Idea:

        go to http://events360.herokuapp.com/, login as admin user, use same login details as mentioned above from seeds.rb file in Event360 repo.
        go to EventNXT and look for the fields to get idea.
        
        Migrate Database
                rails db:migrate
        
        Start server in local development environment
                rails s

**Problems**
If Bundler complains that the wrong Ruby version is installed,
    
        rvm: verify that rvm is installed (for example, rvm --version) and run rvm         
        list to see which Ruby versions are available and rvm use to make a particular     
        version active. If no versions satisfying the Gemfile dependency are               
        installed, you can run rvm install to install a new version, then rvm use to       
        use it.
        
        rbenv: verify that rbenv is installed (for example, rbenv --version) and run       
        rbenv versions to see which Ruby versions are available and rbenv local to         
        make a particular version active. If no versions satisfying the Gemfile            
        dependency are installed, you can run rbenv install to install a new version,      
        then rbenv local to use it.
        
        Then you can try bundle install again.

**How to run Test cases**

- cucumber test cases:

        RAILS_ENV=test rake cucumber
        rails cucumber

- rspec test cases:
        
        bundle exec rspec

**Heroku Deployment:**

It is highly recommended to push the app to heroku using the "Container Registry" method:

1. Download and install the Heroku CLI.

2. Log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.

        heroku login

4. Log in to Container Registry. You must have Docker set up locally to continue. You should see output when you run this command.

        docker ps

5. Push your Docker-based app. Build the Dockerfile in the current directory and push the Docker image

        heroku container:push web -a <your_image>

6. Deploy the changes. Release the newly pushed images to deploy your app.

        heroku container:release web -a <your_image> 
   
7. Use your app link to visit your app.

**Note:** If you notice that your app run into an Application Error.

1. Check your Gemfile.

        Check if your Gemfile has gem "pg"

2. Run"

        bundle install

4. Now, navigate to your app from the heroku dashboard

5. Click on "More" (Top-Right corner, next to 'Open App')

6. Click on "Run console"

7. On the command prompt, run the command:

        rails db:migrate

8. Now, try opening the app.
