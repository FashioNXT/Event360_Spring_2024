[[FashioNXT Git Repo](https://github.com/FashioNXT/planxt)]

[[Deployed App on Heroku](https://planxt-refactor-f6a82d467f0e.herokuapp.com)]



Instructions given below are based on Cloud9 environment. However, you can use your own machine for develop and testing. The app is deployed on Heroku for production.

### To run App in development environment

* Install ruby-3.2.0 using Ruby version manager
  * `rvm get stable`
  * `rvm install "ruby-3.2.0"`
  * `rvm use 3.2.0`

* Install PostgreSQL
  * `sudo apt-get update`
  * `sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev`
  * PostgreSQL may require to create a role to allow rails to connect to the Postgre database. In AWS cloud9 ubuntu system, we executed `sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive ubuntu`

* Clone the latest git repo
  * `git clone https://github.com/FashioNXT/planxt`

* Bundle install
  * `bundle install`
  * `bin/rails db:environment:set RAILS_ENV=development`

* Create and migrate database
```console
rake db:create
```
```console
rake db:schema:load
```
```console
rake db:migrate
```
```console
rake db:seed
```

* Start server in local development environment
  * `rails server`

* To preview the web app in Cloud9
  * Click preview, open in new tab
  * If you will get “IP address mismatch” error, open file `/config/environments/development.rb`, add/update `config.hosts << "YOUR_ADDRESS"`, you can find "YOUR_ADDRESS" from the error message
  * Run `rails server` again to start app
  * Click preview, and click upper right to open a new browser tab to view the app

### To deploy in production environment (Heroku)
* NOTE: This app relies on a 3rd party authentication system
  * To deploy a personal version of this app in production you must authenticate your apps web address on the Event360 central login platform
  * Log in using admin credentials to https://events360.herokuapp.com/ -> "Application Management" -> "New Application"

* Commit all your finished updates to the code, and push to the git repo 
* Prepare rails production environment as shown above

* Install Heroku CLI
  * `npm install -g heroku`

* Now, the App is deployed to the FashioNXT Heroku Account
  * You can link you cloned git repo to the Heroku Account using `heroku git:remote -a example-app` or following instructions given [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#for-an-existing-app)
  * You may need to log in to Heroku first. Contact the client asking for the username and password. You will probably need 2-factor authentication.
* You can push your new commits from the Git to Heroku git repo by `git push heroku main`, the App will automatically be rebuilt to reflect the changes.
* You can check Heroku production logs to analyze bugs using `heroku logs`

<br/>

* If you want to deploy to personal Heroku account:
  * Register a Heroku account
  * Log into Heroku with `heroku login -i`, enter your email
  * If multi-factor authentication is enabled, login the Heroku webpage and get the API key as password to enter in CLI
  * Create an app with `heroku create planxt`
  * Push code to App repo on Heroku, `git push heroku main`
  * Migrate database on Heroku, `heroku run rake db:schema:load db:migrate`
  * App is deployed to Heroku, go to the website and test it out


<br/>

* In case the App is not working correctly in Heroku
  <!-- * Go to Heroku website, `reset the database`  -->
  * `heroku config:set RAILS_ENV=production`
  * then run `heroku run rake db:schema:load db:migrate` 
  * Try again, if still have issues, go to Heroku website and reset the database, then repeate tha above steps

<br/>

### To run cucumber test / RSPEC
```console
RAILS_ENV=test rails server
```

```console
RAILS_ENV=test rake cucumber
```

```console
RSPEC
```

Environment:

* Ruby version - 3.1.0

* Rails version - v7.0.2.2

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

Unit Test:

1 "test add a new item"
 test add a new item into the database. This could add a new item into the fixtures of database and check if it works  
2 "check data plan1 with id 1" 
 "plan1" is a sample data that already exist in the original fixtures of database. This would test the database lookup.

API:

PlanModel:

 Read: GET /plan_models_json/:id
 
 New: POST /plan_models_json
 
 Update: POST /plan_models_json/:id
 
 Delete: DELETE /plan_models_json/:id
